                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">"What do you love doing the most?", "What are your hobbies?", "How do
                    you spend your free time?". We've run into the variations of the aforementioned questions ever since
                    school days, but at some point we've decorated our answers for what the situation asks for. We've
                    all been there right? Whether it's to impress our crush about how endearing it might be if we told
                    them about our interests to match theirs or to impress the interviewer to get the job, the purpose
                    is IMPRESSS them. I guess atleast my 10 year old self was definitely devoid of that purpose because
                    back then I loved watching TV and I would shamelessly mention it as my most loved activity. Well I
                    know what you're thinking, "That's not a hobby, that's a passtime activity everyone does". Yes yes I
                    get it, but hear me out first. You see, when you say you love watching TV, most of them would take
                    it at face value but let me explain what I mean. When I watch TV, I consume information just like
                    when I'm reading a book, I don't just watch content for fun -well that's actually a bonus- but I
                    watch TV, movies, series and all kinds of entertainment media to learn how each language is spoken,
                    how to sound like a native in a language, new words and phrases, funny expressions, witty comebacks
                    and what not (Might appear as a justification to why I binge-watch series and movies, which umm I'm
                    not denying ðŸ˜¬). Little did I know that underneath all of that hunger and curiosity to
                    learn about a new language that I was actually getting better at it. I had a flair for learning
                    languages. Now don't let that deceive you into thinking I am fluent in French or German or whatever
                    the most popular language everyone's learning. No, the point I'm trying to get across is that I love
                    learning a language I fall in love at first sound.<br style="display: block; content: ' '; margin-top: 30px;">

                    Being an Indian, South Indian particularly-you're inherently a multilingual. Why you ask? Because we
                    have 23 official languages in India including English. I mean get this, I am originally from
                    Kerala(a.k.a God's Own Country), my homestate which speaks Malayalam, my parents moved to the
                    buzzling city, Bangalore which is the capital of Karnataka whose state language is Kannada. Schools
                    here in Karnataka teaches Kannada, English and Hindi as mandatory subjects as part of our
                    curriculum. Then we have this ginormous movie industry-Our Indian Cinema-churning out 1500 movies
                    per year which makes us wanna be fluent in atleast one other language for entertainment's sake.
                    There you go! We already know 5 languages by fate if you may say so. So factually speaking we're
                    already polyglots. All I'm trying to say is, we've got bit of a headstart if we were to officially
                    call ourselves Polyglots.<br style="display: block; content: ' '; margin-top: 30px;">

                    One of my proudest moment that I owe to my love for languages happened back in school during my 7th
                    grade. I scored the highest in Kannada beating all of my fellow classmates, most of whom were native
                    speakers. So our school Principal, having noticed that I managed to score the highest even though
                    it's not my mother tongue, decided to praise me in front of the whole class. That right there was
                    one of my happiest days. I owe my mother all of the credits for having discovered this trait in me.
                    Although my mother tongue is Malayalam, growing up in a city of people that migrated from different
                    states here looking for jobs in their early days, I only knew how to speak in my mother tongue, not
                    read or write. That was up until I grew curious of what keeps my Mom engrossed in her Vanitha
                    magazine, a monthly publication in Malayalam, which I believe was the only source that made my Mom
                    feel at home while away from home. She saw me skimming through her beloved magazines only to find
                    out there were two pages dedicated for kids to solve a word puzzle and a coloring activity,
                    everything else was Latin and Greek to me at first glance. But something kept me picking up those
                    magazines and wanting to know how to read. So my Mom finally made it her mission to get me to read
                    Malayalam. You see, it's not really an essential skill, nobody expects you to know how to read in
                    your native tongue, just knowing how to speak is an impressive thing when you live in a city like
                    Bangalore.<br style="display: block; content: ' '; margin-top: 30px;">

                    And then the Hallyu (Korean) wave happened which took the world/internet by storm. So obviously, I
                    moved on to my next love, Korean pop music, drama series and the language. It's the striking
                    resemblance of the intonation, rhythm and tone Korean language holds with most of our Indian
                    languages, that pulled me in and has anchored me for life. Half way into it now, and I've discovered
                    that even the grammar structure is similar. And you see, Youtube's algorithm of recommendations
                    sucked me into the world of Thai BL series, followed by Filipino movies and Spanish music. Right now
                    there's an Indonesian song "Dunia Tipu-Tipu" By Yura Yunita that's on repeat.<br style="display: block; content: ' '; margin-top: 30px;">

                    So to sum it up, if someone were to ask me those same questions today, I'd say "I love learning new
                    languages and proudly call myself a Linguaphile". Wow!! I can't believe I rambled on about it just
                    to answer one question. I don't know where this love of mine is gonna take me on forward in this
                    journey, but I'm sure as heck loving it - learning about the language, its people and the culture,
                    might as well come in handy when I'm out traveling the world while making new friendsðŸ˜‰.<br style="display: block; content: ' '; margin-top: 30px;">
